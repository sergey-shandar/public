current problem:
content ownership. Git and IPFS partly solve the problem of content ownership but not completely. digital signatures, licensing and respecting historical data and formats. 

 people use different platforms to connect (emails, SMS, different messengers, centralized social netwowrs, decentralized social networks like Nostr and BlueSky) but because different people use different networks, we are disconnected with our friends, colleges, communities. (fragmentation). Instead of receiving information from people we trust, we receive spam, phishing, and propaganda from mass media. (trust)

If we store information in our own local CAS, we can deduplicatr and backup the information.
