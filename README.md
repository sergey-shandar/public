# Sergey Shandar

I'm working on content-addressable internet (CAi). The main CAi principles are
- Address by content for immutable data.
- Address by decentralized identity for mutable data.
- Protocol agnostic. It doesn't matter how we receive a message if we can validate it.
- Future proof. CAi has a mechanism to support different hash functions and decentralize identities.

Current OSS projects that I'm working on 
- [Blockset](https://github.com/datablockset/blockset) is a personal [CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage) with unique properties:
  - Utilizes a unique hash function to detect data duplication and reduce storage size and traffic.
  - Can be synchronized via file copy.
- [FunctionalScript](https://github.com/functionalscript) is a purely functional subset of JavaScript. One of the goals of the language is to support CAi, similar to how JavaScript supports the current location-based internet.
