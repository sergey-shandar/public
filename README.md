# Sergey Shandar

I'm building a data block set tailored for individual use, inspired by [CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage). While CAS systems have found a place in some companies, many individuals remain sidelined. I aim to democratize this tech, ensuring universal accessibility and paving the way for a new ecosystem of applications and services. It unlocks so many possibilities, like decentralized protocol-agnostic social networks, seamless data synchronization, affordable data backup, better version control systems, deterministic build systems, and much more.

Currently, my primary focus areas include:

- **[Personal Data Block Set](https://github.com/datablockset/blockset)**: a specialized data storage approach that places individuals at the helm of their data.
- **[FunctionalScript](https://github.com/functionalscript/functionalscript)**: an optimized subset of ECMAScript (aka JavaScript), devised to tackle the challenges of distributed computing without adding to the learning burden.

Sorry, I'm not hiring. However, if you want to build your own services and applications on top of a data block set, don't hesitate to contact me. The ecosystem is in its infancy, so there is a lot of space for growth.
