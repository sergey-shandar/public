I'm building a data block set tailored for individual use, inspired by [CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage). A universal personal data block set is long overdue in the industry, and I firmly believe we need one ASAP. It unlocks so many possibilities, like decentralized protocol-agnostic social networks, seamless data synchronization, affordable data backup, better version control systems, deterministic build systems, and much much more.

Currently, my primary focus areas include:

- **Personal Data Block Set**: a specialized data storage approach that places individuals at the helm of their data.
- **[FunctionalScript]((https://github.com/functionalscript/functionalscript))**: An optimized subset of ECMAScript (aka JavaScript), devised to tackle the challenges of distributed computing without adding to the learning burden.
