I'm working on developing the content-addressable internet (CAi). The core CAi principles are
- **Addressing Immutable Data:** Using cryptographic hashes of content as an address.
- **Addressing Mutable Data:** Using decentralized identities and digital signatures.
- **Protocol Agnostic:** Validating messages regardless of the protocol used to receive them.
- **Scalability:** Enhancing algorithms and software without altering the source of truth data.
- **Future Proof:** Implementing mechanisms to support evolving hash functions and decentralized identities.
- **Verifyible Social Connections:** New connections can be verified by the connection graph, and a trust rating can be assigned. Also, trusted connections can restore stolen or lost decentralized identity and revert fraud transactions.

Current OSS projects that I'm working on 
- [Blockset](https://github.com/datablockset/blockset) is a personal [CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage) with unique properties:
  - Utilizes a unique hash function to detect data duplication, reducing storage size and network traffic.
  - Can be synchronized via simple file copy.
- [FunctionalScript](https://github.com/functionalscript) is a purely functional subset of JavaScript. One of the goals of the language is to support CAi, similar to how JavaScript supports the current location-based internet.
