# Sergey Shandar

I'm building a data block set, also known as [CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage) mostly for individual use. A universal standard personal data block set is something that is long overdue in the industry and I strongly beleive we need one ASAP. 
It unlooks so many possibilities, like decentralized protocol agnostic social network, semless data synchronization, affordable data back-up storages, better version control systems, determenistic build systems and much much more.
