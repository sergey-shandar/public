# What the heck is content-addressable internet?

In the previous articles, I highlighted some problems with Web2 and the current location-based Internet. The main idea of the CAI is to use a result of different cryptographic functions of content as an address instead of a location (like an IP address).

One of the main properties of content-addressable Internet is protocol agnosticism. Protocol agnosticism means that it doesn't matter how we receive data; as soon as we can validate and prove some vital hypothesis about the nature of the data offline. For example, we can do these operations offline: check a hash value, validate a digital signature, and decrypt messages using asymmetric cryptography.

## Layer 0

## Layer 1

A cryptographic function that converts a private key to a public key creates a decentralized identity.

Then, we can keep the private key and use it to sign our messages.

### Layer 1.1

Trusted time stamps. Requires trusted centralized services or consensus of many users, like in blockchain.

## Layer 2

Relative names.
