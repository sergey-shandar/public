# What the heck is content-addressable internet?

The main idea of the CAI is to use a result of a cryptographic function of content (like a hash) as an address instead of location (like an IP address).

## Level 1

A cryptographic function that converts a private key to a public key creates a decentralized identity.

Then, we can keep the private key and use it to sign our messages.

### Level 1.1

Trusted time stamps.

## Level 2

Relative names.
