# Economic Justice in the Digital Age

We have a lot of computational power, but we still use archaic, unfair taxation systems that destroy economies, lives, and societies. Current systems look more like a casino than a positive-sum game. 
No matter what you do, your economic state depends a lot on chance. Here, I formulated principles that should fix some of the problems. These principles are obvious and relatively easy to implement in our digital epoch.

## The first principle: more earnings means more receiving

Let's take two people, Bob and Charlie. They are absolutely identical in everything except income.
The first principle is that if Charlie earns more than Bob, then Charlie must receive at least as much as Bob after taxes. Let's call `x` how much a person earns and `y` how much a person gets. Now, the function `y = f(x)` is a non-decreasing function.

Also, all income should be considered the same for tax purposes. Doesn't matter if it comes from salary, business profit, or bank interest. We should not open doors for tax optimizations.

Examples that violate the principle: benefit cliff.

### The second principle: Basic human rights

Every person has a right to live. It means at least basic things: breath, food, accommodation, and basic health care. Even people in prison receive these basic rights. Why don't law-abiding individuals have these rights? Why do we force people to break a law to have these basic rights? The statement is that people should have at least the same benefits that they can receive in jail. Then, we can't start with zero; we must have UBI if we agree with these first two principles. `y = f(x) + U`, where `U` is UBI.

## The third principle. Progressive taxes

If Charlie earns more than Bob, he must pay at least the same tax percentage.

Examples of violations: social security tax.

The progressive taxes work well to fight the growing inequality in wealth redistribution when the working class is getting poorer and poorer every year. The best candidates are `y = K * log(1 + x/K) + U`. 

## The fourth principle. Accumulated tax

If Bob received the same total amount as Charlie for the same period, they should pay the same taxes in total. For example, if Bob received $50K for the first year, and then $50K for the second year, and Charlie received $90K for the first year and the $10K for the second year, they should pay the same taxes for two years.

This opens an interesting perspective, people who worked all their lives will receive a tax return as soon as they lose their job or decide to retire. So, it can replace a pension or add additional money for retired people.

Another option is a student who may live on UBI during their studies and then pay less taxes for the first few years when they accept a high-paying job.
