# Economic Justice in the Digital Age

We have a lot of computational power, but we still use archaic, unfair taxation systems that destroy economies, lives, and societies. Current systems look more like a casino than a positive-sum game. 
No matter what you do, your economic state depends a lot on chance. Here, I formulated principles that should fix some of the problems. These principles are obvious and relatively easy to implement in our digital epoch.

## The first principle: more earnings means more receiving

Let's take two people, Bob and Charlie. They are absolutely identical in everything except income.
The first principle is that if Charlie earns more than Bob, then Charlie must receive at least as much as Bob after taxes. Let's call `x` how much a person earns and `y` how much a person gets. Now, the function `y = f(x)` is a non-decresing function.

Examples that violate the principle: benefit cliff.

### The second principle: Basic human rights

Every person has a right to live. It means at least basic things: breath, food, accomodation and basic health care. Even people in prison receive these basic rights. Why people who don't break law don't have these rights? Why do we force people to break a law to have these basic rights? The statement is that people should have at least the same benefits that can receive at jail. Then, we can't start with zero, we must have UBI if we agree with these first two principlee. `y = f(x) + U`, where `U` is UBI.

## The third principle. Progressive taxes

If Charlie earns more than Bob, he must pay at leat the same tax percentage.

Examples of violation: social security tax. The biggest percentage is on working class.

The progressive taxes works well to fight the growing abnormality in welth redistribution when working class is getting poorer and poorer every year. The best candidates are `y = K * log(1 + x/K) + U`. 

## The forth principle. Accumulated tax

If Bob received in total the same amount as Charlie for the same period, they should pay the same taxes in total. For example, if Bob received $50K for the first year, and then $50K for the second year, and Charlie recieved $90K for the first year and the $10K for the second year, the should pay the same taxes for two years.

This open intresting perspective, people who worked all their live will recieve a tax return as soon as they are lose their job or decided to retire. So, it can replace pension or add additional money to retired people.

Another option is a student who may live on UBI during his study and then pay less taxes for the first few years when he accepts high paing job.
