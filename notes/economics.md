# Econimic Principles

- Motivation:
  - more earn => more received
- An economic target for  society (constant improvement):
  - generate more value
  - no poor people: a big chunk of the generated value is distributed to low and middle-income earners
  Criteria: Progress should benefit everyone, but that doesn't mean it should benefit everyone equally. We should avoid situations where progress benefits only a few and makes it worse for others.
    - if a person creates a product and then an AI-based automated factory crates the same product cheaper, they can lose their income if they try to sell the product for the same price. Assumptions: an AI-based factory and a person buy resources for the same price.
- Balance: money is a power, so it must be limited:
  - Receiving is a logarithm from earning.
  - it also has a universal basic income.
- Tax on accumulated value. These people should pay the same accumulated tax:
  - `0,0,0,0,5` and `1,1,1,1,1`.
  It also can work as a pension:
  - `5,0,0,0,0` means a high tax on the first year and negative tax on the consequent years.
  - inheritance is treated as an income.
- Real economic value.
  - What is the total economic impact if two companies innovate and compete in the same industry and one wins?
  - Imagine we have multiple ways and need to know which is more profitable. Each business takes a different way, and only one of them survives. Is there value in a business that didn't survive? From a social point of view, yes. Because now we know which way is the best.
- UBI is one of the simplest solutions that follows the motivation principle. Poor people can't afford good financial advisors, bookkeepers, and accountants to optimize and track their income, so they lose more on average. We need very, very simple rules for the poor and middle class. They also can't afford risks that can be beneficial on average. For example, a choice:
  1.  $1,000,000 with 100%,
  2.  $3,000,000 with 50%.
  Poor people will most likely make the first choice. Rich people can afford to take the second choice and win on average.

## Anti investment economy

An anti-investment economy is one in which businesses usually have enough money to participate in the economy. It is hard to find a business that would like to accept investment.
