# Econimic Principles

- Motivation:
  - more earn => more received
- An economic target for  society (constant improvement):
  - generate more value
  - no poor people: a big chunk of the generated value is distributed to low and middle-income earners
  - criteria: the progress should benefit everyone.
    - if a person creates a product and then an AI-based automated factory crates the same product cheaper, then a person can lose their income if they try to sell the product for the same price. Assumptions: an AI-based factory and a person but resources for the same price.
- Balance: money is a power, so it must be limited:
  - Receiving is a logarithm from earning.
  - it also has a universal basic income.
- Tax on accumulated value. These people should pay the same accumulated tax:
  - `0,0,0,0,5` and `1,1,1,1,1`.
  It also can work as a pension:
  - `5,0,0,0,0` means a high tax on the first year and negative tax on the consequent years.
  - inheritance is treated as an income.
- Real economic value.
  - What is the total economic impact if two companies innovate and compete in the same industry and one wins?
  - Imagine we have multiple ways and need to know which is more profitable. Each business takes a different way, and only one of them survives. Is there value in a business that didn't survive? From a social point of view, yes. Because now we know which way is the best.
