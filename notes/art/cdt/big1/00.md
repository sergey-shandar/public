There are a lot of articles, videos, and blog posts about functional programming using different programming languages, including JavaScript.

Usually, the main topic of these articles is how to use various functional programming paradigms, such as first-class functions, immutable objects, and currying.

Nevertheless, the primary value of purely functional programming languages is an absence of side effects. Partial applications of different functional paradigms in impure languages, such as JavaScript, may reduce the number of side effects but don't guarantee their complete elimination.

Side effects reduce scalability and the ability to replace components and platforms. So, it is preferable to reduce the number of side effects to a bare minimum.

There are dozens of purely functional programming languages. Some of them are pretty successful in the software development industry - for example, Haskell, Elm, and PureScript. However, the most popular programming language is JavaScript, and it is not purely functional.

The main reason to use JavaScript, besides its popularity, is that almost any web browser can run it. Also, one of the most popular data interchange and file formats is JSON, a subset of JavaScript. Because of this JSON/JavaScript relation, serialization in JavaScript is more straightforward than in other programming languages. In my experience, object-oriented programming languages usually have the biggest challenges in serialization.

Any working program has side effects such as input/output, functions that return the current time, or random numbers.

But it is possible to write a big part of a program without using impure functions. An impure function can be rewritten as a pure function.
