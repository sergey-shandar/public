# Building Digital Universes

## Information

- measurements as a number of states in a system vs bits
- imagine that mass is proportional to information in the case of constant mass in the Universe
  - additions as a `log(states)`.
  - resolution is not linear
  - divisible. A system with a prime number of states is not divisible.
 
Note: Relations between systems can define a lot of information

## Probability

It's a measure of our ignorance (0% and 100% - absolute knowledge, 50% - absolute ignorance), so it's subjective, not objective. For example, poker.

To build a Universe with randomness, we can either build a pseudo-random function or calculate and keep all possible cases. Note that it's possible that we have two Universes that are the same but have different histories (paths). In this case, knowing the path based only on information from the Universe state is impossible.

## Normal Distribution

- Throwing a coin. Move if `head`, stay if `tail`.
- Repeat.
- Normal distribution

We can use it to generate a normal distribution. However, it is not efficient because many paths lead to the same outcome.

Normal distribution on a plane. Form a circle?

## 137 Infinite Sequence

CDT.

Using the algorithm, we can build an infinite bit sequence that contains all possible finite bit sequences.
