# Building Imaginary Universes. 1. Information

One question I sometimes ask myself is, based on knowledge about our world and logic, what kind of universes are possible?

This article is based on a series of questions I asked myself and the most simple questions I could come up with. If you find mistakes in my answers or have a better answer, please let me know in the comments. In this case, the answer that is correct, simpler, and more precise is better.

- _What are the main building blocks of any universe we can imagine?_ It's information. 
- How do we measure information? Usually, we measure information in [bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte). For example, my computer has a memory of 8 [gigabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte), which equals about 8 billion bytes.
- Can we divide the byte into smaller parts? Yes, we can. Each byte contains 8 [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit).
An object with only two possible states can be mapped into one bit, while an object with only one state doesn't carry any information. So, one bit is the smallest indivisible unit of information.
- Can we build a universe using only bits? Perhaps, yes. At least all modern computers operate with bits, and we can model many things using them.
- Can we have other indivisible units of information? Actually, yes. For example, an [object with three states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_numeral_system) can't fit into one bit, but an object with two bits has four states and can't fit into our three-state object.
- In how many states can two objects be? It's a [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics)) of their states. For example, the number of states in two bits is 4, 2 by 2.
- How can we know that an object is indivisible? If an object has a [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) of states, then this object is indivisible.

If we are building a universe that conserves a number of states in objects, similar to the [conservation laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law) in our world, then our indivisible objects are objects that have a prime number of states and a divisible object has a number of states which equals to a product of its subobject states. For example, an object that has 6 states can be divided into two objects with 2 states and 3 states.

One main difference is that in our world when we create one object from two, we usually add their properties rather than multiplying them. For example, two 1 kg watermelons have a 2 kg mass.

Information in bits. A number of states are more precise. The system with one state doesn't hold any information. 

if we have two systems with n0 and n1 states then the number of combined states will be n0 and n1. if we try to divide a system with m states to two subsystems we need to find such natural numbers n0 and n1 that n0*n1 equals m. 

If a system has a prime number of states, then such system is indivisible. The systems with the same number of states are not distinguishable.
