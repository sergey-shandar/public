Information in bits. A number of states is more precise. The system with 1 state doesn't hold any information. 

if we have two systems with n0 and n1 states then the number of combined states will be n0 and n1. if we try to divide a system with m states to two subsystems we need to find such natural numbers n0 and n1 that n0*n1 equals m. 

If a system has a prime number of states, then such system is indivisible. The systems with the same number of states are not distinguishable.
