# Type of systems

## 1. Linear (Deterministic)

There are no differences between the past and the future. The amount of information is the same at every step.

## 2. Tree/DAQ (Probabilistic, Multiverse)

Try all possible variations. It has an arrow of time.

When we introduce a random number, we can either:

- add a new state
- replace the existing one (delete history)
