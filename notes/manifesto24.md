# Manifesto

At least in my mind, a manifesto is associated with something intrusive and aggressive. This one is more about problems and solutions in our digital life.

So, what are the problems with the digital space? For me, the most significant problems are data/identity ownership and trust.

## Vision

## Steps towards CAI

## Competitors

Any true competitor should build products according to the CAI. It means people can use it with existing CAI products on the same data without risking losing everything. I would be glad if we had more people working in this area, and I would love to use their products. And if it's better, it means I found a solution for my personal problems in the digital space. In this case, I can switch my focus to other subjects. They can be related to the solution, such as building decentralized, community, and personal AI on top of CAI, or unrelated. There should be enough work for me and my team. I would also be glad to switch my focus to learning more about society structure, game theory, the global economy, quantum physics, and information physics. Please make better CAI products so I can retire and have fun. Anyway, it's a win-win situation. Or, as a big fan of the [Arrival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)), we can call it a non-zero-sum game.
