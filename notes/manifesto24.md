# Manifesto

At least in my mind, a manifesto is associated with something intrusive and aggressive. This one is more about problems and solutions in our digital life.

So, what are the problems with the digital space? For me, the most significant problems are data/identity ownership and trust.

## Vision

## Steps towards CAI

## Competitors

Any real competitor is building products according to the CAI principles or better. This means people can use it with existing CAI products on the same data without risking losing everything. I would be glad to have more people working in this area and would love to use their products and services. Even better, I would be happy to help them. For me, they are not competitors; they are partners.

And if their products are better, I have found a solution for my personal problems in the digital space. In this case, I can switch my focus to other subjects. They can be related to CAI, such as building decentralized, community, and personal AI on top of CAI, or unrelated. There should be enough work for me and my team. I would also be glad to switch my focus to learning more about society structure, game theory, the global economy, quantum physics, and information physics. Please, make better CAI products so I can retire. Anyway, it's a win-win situation. Or, as a big fan of the [Arrival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)), I would call it a non-zero-sum game.

### Analysis of Existing Products

- Social Networks:
  - [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) is very close, and we may use some of their formats, so our products will be able to post and get data from Nostr into CAS.
  - [BlueSky](https://bsky.social/), as far as I understood, their protocol works on content-addressable data and IPFS. I'm not sure if they support properly decentralized identities and public-private keys.
  - [Matrix](https://matrix.org/), it looks like a Discord alternative rather than a public space. 
- Decentralized Source Control Systems such as [Git], [Mercurial] are very cool. However, they have two major problems:
  1. They are not generic CAS systems, so we still rely on such centralized services as GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket for tracking issues, PRs, project management, etc.
  2. Digital identities are not the main features, and commit, and branches can be without digital signatures.
