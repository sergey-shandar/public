# Decentralized Digital Space

There are a lot of discussions about decentralized internet, no-vendor lock-in, independent social networks, and so on. But how do you recognize which service gives you freedom and which is just hypocrisy and lies? I've formulated several principles that real decentralized service should work on to give users freedom in the digital space. It can work as a test; if a service doesn't satisfy some of these requirements, then it doesn't give you real ownership of your data.

These principles are primarily for me, and I would really appreciate feedback.

Goals:

- no-vendor lock-in. Everything you create belongs to you.
- public/private communication between two parties doesn't need centralized authorities or decentralized consensus. 
- future-proof. (upgrading cryptographic algorithms).
- protocol and data format agnostic.
- It can work offline or in isolated sub-networks, and then it can be easily merged and forked again. There is no need for a centralized authority or decentralized consensus.
- Services (as other participants) have the right to ban or remove your account, but they can't delete your data. You have the right to use multiple services for the same data.
- Trusted networks, people have the right to know and control the source of information.

Principles:

- The main principle is cryptographic proofs.
- content-addressable storage:
  - protocol-agnostic conflict-free synchronization.
  - upgradable hashes.
- asymmetric encryption:
  - decentralized identity
- relative names
  - There is no need to register a name with centralized authorities or look for a decentralized consensus

Potential:

- trusted decentralized networks:
  - easy to detect sources of spam, disinformation, and misinformation
  - see information and advertisements from trusted, locally rated sources about topics that you are interested in and promote close connections and local businesses
