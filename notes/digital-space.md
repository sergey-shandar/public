# Digital Space

## What's Digital Space?

Digital space means all digital storages and all computers. It doesn't matter if they are online or offline or create an isolated network. 

Content-addresses based on cryptographic hashes allow to address and process information in the digital space without conflicts and ambiguities. The main feature of content-addresses is that if we have a content address and the content that we received from someone, we can always verify that the content has this address. That's the foundation of distributed and decentralized systems.

## Optimization Of Verification

One problem with verification is that we need the whole content before we can say if the content address belongs to it. Merkle Tree can help with this.
