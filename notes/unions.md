Many small democratic countries, such as New Zealand, Canada, Australia, Uruguay, and Japan, are not members of democratic unions. Without unions and collective protection, these countries are at risk of various attacks, including economic ones. 

One of the biggest problems is that businesses in these countries have limited markets to grow. Without trade unions and access to big markets, these countries can't afford big projects like space exploration, aviation, weapons, nuclear fusion, and other scientific and technological projects. Because of this, some companies have to move to countries or unions with bigger markets, such as the EU. In the last decade, I have observed examples of these risks becoming increasingly real: Brexit, military invasions in Ukraine, and growing isolationism in the USA.

One idea for such a union is [CANZUK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANZUK). The project has been criticized, but in my opinion, we need such or similar unions. In the long term, they're beneficial for all democratic countries because they can create alternatives and healthy competition to existing unions and, simultaneously, make the democratic world stronger and with more coordinated responses to existential challenges.
