I'm not an economist, so please correct me if I make mistakes. Consider these articles an invitation to dialogue.

I like to build models for different subjects in my mind. However, to build a model, I have to understand the fundamental laws it must follow.

These fundamental laws are akin to the laws of physics. For example, the first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created from nothing. Similarly, in economics, there is a comparable fundamental law: the true driver of sustainable economic growth is value creation, such as producing final goods and services that genuinely address real needs without creating hidden liabilities for the future. Redistribution of value alone does not create new value, like moving energy doesn't produce more energy.

Sometimes, I see that people draw conclusions about the economy without fully grasping this law. For example, there’s a common assumption that simply redistributing value can somehow generate more of it. While redistribution can improve access and efficiency by reallocating resources, it doesn’t produce value directly. It may address inequalities and create new opportunities, but it ultimately depends on ongoing value creation to support long-term economic growth.

Another similar pitfall I often observe is the tendency to project the success of a few individuals onto the entire economy. For instance, if some people become wealthy by trading assets or holding them for long-term gains, there’s sometimes an assumption that everyone could achieve wealth similarly. In reality, if everyone adopted this strategy, nobody would produce anything of real value, and the economy would eventually collapse. Sustainable growth depends on a diversity of contributions, not on speculative individual gains alone.

If we build an economy without a clear focus on these fundamental laws, it is likely to decline over time. Even if we experience short-term economic gains, these may be akin to relying on borrowed resources and accumulating debts that will eventually need to be repaid. For example, producing cheap goods that harm health or the environment might appear profitable in the short run, but the long-term costs to society and the economy can be immense as the negative consequences unfold.
