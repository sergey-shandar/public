I'm not an economist; however, in my opinion, there are fundamental laws in economics that people often get wrong. One of the most common misconceptions is the belief that redistributing value somehow produces new value. While redistribution can address inequalities, it doesn't create the value needed to sustain an economy.

These fundamental laws are like the laws of physics. For example, the first law of thermodynamics prohibits the creation of energy from nothing. Similarly, in economics, if value is not actively produced, we inevitably become poorer on average, no matter how we redistribute existing values and money.

The real driver of economic growth is value creation: producing goods, services, and innovations that meet real needs. Without a focus on creating value, redistribution alone cannot sustain a thriving economy.
