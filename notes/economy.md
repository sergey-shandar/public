I'm not an economist, so please correct me if I make mistakes. Consider these articles an invitation to dialogue.

I enjoy building models in my mind for different subjects. However, to build a model, I have to understand the fundamental laws it must follow.

These fundamental laws are akin to the laws of physics. For example, the first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created from nothing. Similarly, in economics, there is a fundamental principle: the true driver of sustainable economic growth is value creation—producing final goods and services that genuinely address real needs without creating hidden liabilities for the future. Redistribution of value alone does not generate new value, just as moving energy around doesn’t create more energy.

Sometimes, I see that people draw conclusions about the economy without fully grasping this principle. For example, there’s a common assumption that simply redistributing value can somehow generate more of it. While redistribution can improve access and efficiency by reallocating resources, it doesn’t directly create value. It may address inequalities and open up new opportunities, but it still relies on ongoing value creation to sustain long-term economic growth.

A similar pitfall I often observe is the tendency to project the success of a few individuals onto the entire economy. For instance, if some people become wealthy by trading assets or holding them for long-term gains, there’s sometimes an assumption that everyone could achieve wealth similarly. In reality, if everyone adopted this strategy, nobody would be producing anything of real value, and the economy would eventually collapse. Sustainable growth relies on a diversity of contributions, not on speculative individual gains alone.

If we build an economy without a clear focus on these fundamental laws, it is likely to decline over time. Even if we experience short-term economic gains, these may be akin to relying on borrowed resources and accumulating debts that will eventually need to be repaid. For instance, producing cheap goods that harm health or the environment might seem profitable in the short run, but the long-term costs to society and the economy can be immense as the negative consequences unfold.
