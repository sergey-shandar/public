- noice. the task of an engineer is simplification. noice is expensive.
- abstraction layers. we use it all the time, we don't need to know how a specific car works to drive it. But some basic knowledge can help.
- what's wrong with current decentralized systems, we speak about protocols as about transport layer. an abstraction layers that we would like to have is "Doesn't matter how we receive the message if we can prove statements about the message".

- Proofs vs protocols. Protocol agnostic.
- Limited authorities:
  - Time Stamping Authority. They could be replaced by blockchain or other collective consensus algorithms.
  - Others, if needed, such as bridges to Web2, DNS, etc.
  But, it's a user choice!
