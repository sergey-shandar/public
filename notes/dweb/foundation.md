I think a lot about how to structure the foundation for the new decentralized web correctly. So my latest structure:

1. **CAS** is a content-addressable storage. The storage is unaware of the content structure and relations between data blocks.
2. **DISOT** is a Decentralized, Immutable Source Of Truth. It achieves the same goal as [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) but without centralized or decentralized authorities or registers. It includes digital signatures and revision formats for mutable data.
3. **Trusted Networks**. This is where the fun and opportunities are. It's about weighted subjective trust, reducing information noise, and playing a positive-sum game with others.

I have a clear understanding of how to implement 1 and 2 that is future-proof. There is still a lot of work to be done on 3.
