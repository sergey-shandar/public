I'm a developer and use multiple languages and frameworks. Most of them use some kind of configuration files. For example MSBuild ('.vcproj'), CMake, Node.js (project.json), TypeScript (tsconfig.json) etc. Long time ago XML was the first candidate for configuration, communication and small data bases. Then the industry mostly switched to JSON and similar formats. JSON uses a small subset of JavaScript basic types and syntax. Because of this, using JSON is much easier than XML, at least for me. I always know how the JSON data is [de]serialized since it maps to JavaScript one to one. Usually, it's not a problem for other languages as well. Most of the modern languages have JSON types: number, string, boolean, array, dictionary and null.
