I'm a developer and use multiple languages and frameworks. Most of them use some kind of configuration files. For example MSBuild ('.vcproj'), CMake, Node.js (project.json), TypeScript (tsconfig.json) etc. Long time ago XML was the first candidate for configuration, communication and small data bases. Then the industry mostly switched to JSON and similar formats. JSON uses a small subset of JavaScript basic types and syntax.
