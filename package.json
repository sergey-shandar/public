While CAS systems have found a place in some companies, many individuals remain sidelined. I aim to democratize this tech, ensuring universal accessibility and paving the way for a new ecosystem of applications and services. It unlocks so many possibilities, like decentralized protocol-agnostic social networks, seamless data synchronization, affordable data backup, better version control systems, deterministic build systems, and much more.",
